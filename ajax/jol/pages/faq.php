<ul>
<li> It is more secure than normal e-mail.  
<li> You don't have to worry about the size of file and being rejected because their e-mail server won't allow a file that big or their e-mail is full.  
<li> If you send a file to several people and discover you forgot someone you don't have to upload the attachment again. Simply send the <?php echo $sitename ?> file link to the person you forgot.
